Software Dev projects

Custom web application developed during a Data Scientist role in Banking.

All code is completely my own and exercises Object Oriented and Pythonic style programming. This application is a Data Visualisation project
that takes in API data and presents sentiment and text analytics through interactive graphs using Bokeh. 

It's original scope can be extended to apply further text and NLP machine learning classification.
